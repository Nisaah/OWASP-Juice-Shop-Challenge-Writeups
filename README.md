## Findings
## 1. Accessing Hidden Files via robots.txt and Null Byte Injection in Juice Shop
### Explanation
robots.txt Discovery
While exploring the application, accessed the /robots.txt file: https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com/robots.txt
and saw:
<pre>User-agent: *
Disallow: /ftp</pre>
This told us that the /ftp directory is intentionally hidden from web crawlers.
#### Exploring /ftp
Since /ftp was disallowed, it hinted that there might be something interesting there.
<pre>https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com/ftp</pre>
showed a list of files, including acquisitions.md,eastere.gg,announcement_encrypted.md, legal.md, etc
#### Access restriction on eastere.gg
Attempting to access the file directly:
<pre>https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com/ftp/eastere.gg</pre>
resulted in a 403 Forbidden error with the message:
<pre>Only .md and .pdf files are allowed!</pre>
The application had a security filter restricting access to files by extension, allowing only .md and .pdf files.
#### Bypassing with Null Byte Injection
Using Null Byte Injection â€” a technique where a special %00 (null byte) character is inserted in the filename, allows bypassing the file extension check.
We accessed:
<pre>https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com/ftp/eastere.gg%2500.md</pre>
where %2500 is the URL-encoded form of %00 (null byte).
This tricks the filter into thinking the filename ends with .md, passing the check, but the system reads it as eastere.gg.

Congratulations, you found the easter egg!
